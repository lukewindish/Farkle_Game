# Farkle

## Objective

The player who _reaches_ **10,000 points** first _wins_

## How to Play

Each **player** takes turns _rolling_ the **dice**. When its your turn, you _roll_ all **six dice** at the same time. **Points** are earned every time you _roll_ a **1 or 5**, **three of a kind**, **three pairs**, **a six-dice straight** (1,2,3,4,5,6), or **two triplets**.

If none of your **dice** earned points, thats a '**Farkle**!'

If you rolled at least one scoring die, you can _bank_ your points and pass the **die** to the next player, or _risk_ the points you just earned during this **round** by putting some or all of the winning die (dice) aside and _rolling_ the remaining **dice**. The remaining dice may earn you additional **points**, but if you _Farkle_, you _lose_ everything you earned during the round.

**Scoring** is based only on the dice in each roll. You cannot earn points by combining dice from different rolls. You can continue rolling the dice until you either _Pass_ or _Farkle_. Then the next player rolls the six dice until they _Pass_ or _Farkle_. Play continues until it is your turn again.

*Scoring* goes as follows:
1. one 5 die = 50 points
1. one 1 die = 100 points
1. triplet of 1s = 1000 points
1. triplet of 2s = 200 points
1. triplet of 3s = 300 points
1. triplet of 4s = 400 points
1. triplet of 5s = 500 points
1. triplet of 6s = 600 points
1. six-die straight = 1500 points
1. 3 pairs = 1500 points
1. 2 triplets = 2500 points
1. 4 of a kind = 1000 points
1. 5 of a kind = 2000 points
1. 6 of a kind = 3000 points
