## How to Play
Each player takes turns rolling the dice. When its your turn, you roll all six dice at the same time. Points are earned every time you roll a 1 or 5, three of a kind, three pairs, a six-dice straight (1,2,3,4,5,6), or two triplets.

If none of your dice earned points, thats a 'Farkle!'

If you rolled at least one scoring die, you can bank your points and pass the diece to the next player, or risk the points you just earned during this round by putting some or all of the winning die (dice) aside and rolling the remaining dice. The remaining dice may earn you additional points, but if you Farkle, you lose everything you earned during the round.

Scoring is based only on the dice in each roll. You cannot earn points by combining dice from different rolls. You can continue rolling the dice until you either Pass or Farkle. Then the next player rolls the six dice until they Pass or Farkle. Play continues until it is your turn again.

Scoring goes as follows:
1. one 5 die = 50 points
1. one 1 die = 100 points
1. triplet of 1s = 1000 points
1. triplet of 2s = 200 points
1. triplet of 3s = 300 points
1. triplet of 4s = 400 points
1. triplet of 5s = 500 points
1. triplet of 6s = 600 points
1. six-die straight = 1500 points
1. 3 pairs = 1500 points
1. 2 triplets = 2500 points
1. 4 of a kind = 1000 points
1. 5 of a kind = 2000 points
1. 6 of a kind = 3000 points
